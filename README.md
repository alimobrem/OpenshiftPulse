# ShiftOps

A next-generation OpenShift Console — scored **93/100** by a Senior SysAdmin reviewer and recommended as **"primary tool for single-cluster day-2 operations."** Built with React, TypeScript, and real-time Kubernetes APIs. Every view is auto-generated from the API — browse any resource type, see what needs attention, and take action in seconds.

**Live on cluster**: Deployed with OAuth proxy for multi-user authentication.

## Highlights

- **67 automated health checks** across cluster readiness and domain-specific audits
- **36 workload/storage/networking/compute/RBAC/identity checks** with per-resource pass/fail, YAML fix examples, and "Edit YAML" links
- **Workload health audit on detail pages** — 7 checks per Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet
- **RBAC-aware UI** — actions hidden/disabled based on user permissions
- **User impersonation** — test as any user or service account
- **Metrics sparklines** on every overview page with threshold-based colors
- **Alert silence lifecycle** — create, pre-fill from alerts, expire
- **Operator lifecycle** — install, progress tracking, post-install guidance, uninstall
- **1103 tests** across 66 test files

## Features

### Health Audits (36 Domain Checks + 31 Cluster Checks = 67 Total)
Each overview page has an expandable audit with score %, per-resource pass/fail, "Why it matters" explanations, YAML fix examples, and direct "Edit YAML" links.

- **Workloads (6)**: Resource limits, liveness probes, readiness probes, PDBs, replicas, rolling update strategy
- **Storage (6)**: Default StorageClass, PVC binding, reclaim policy, WaitForFirstConsumer, volume snapshots, storage quotas
- **Networking (6)**: Route TLS, network policies, NodePort avoidance, ingress controller health, route admission, egress policies
- **Compute (6)**: HA control plane, dedicated workers, MachineHealthChecks, node pressure, kubelet version consistency, cluster autoscaling
- **Access Control (6)**: Default SA privileges, overprivileged bindings, wildcard rules, stale bindings, namespace isolation, automount tokens
- **Identity (6)**: Identity providers, kubeadmin removal, cluster-admin audit, SA privileges, inactive users, group membership

### Workload Health on Detail Pages
Every Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet detail page shows per-container health checks: resource limits, resource requests, liveness probes, readiness probes, HA replicas, update strategy, and security context (runAsNonRoot, privilege escalation, capabilities). Expandable rows show probe descriptions.

### Builds
BuildConfigs with one-click trigger, average build duration, last build status. Builds table with status, strategy, duration, timestamps. In-progress and failed builds panels. ImageStreams with tag badges.

### Cluster Config (10 Editable Sections)
OAuth, Proxy, Image, Ingress, Scheduler, API Server (full editors). DNS (warning: breaks routing), Network (warning: cluster disruption), FeatureGate (warning: irreversible), Console (product name, logo, route, statuspage).

### Cluster Upgrades
Pre-update checklist (nodes ready, operators healthy, channel, etcd backup, PDBs), ClusterVersion conditions (Progressing/Failing banners), version skip indicators, risk badges, duration estimates, per-operator update progress during rolling upgrade, history with duration.

### Operator Catalog & Lifecycle
Browse 500+ operators. One-click install with 4-step progress tracking. Post-install guidance for 9+ operators. Full uninstall flow. Channel selector, namespace auto-suggestion.

### Alerts & Silence Management
Severity filters (Critical/Warning/Info), group by namespace or alertname, firing duration display, silenced indicators, runbook links, silence creation from any alert, silence expiration with confirmation.

### User Management & Impersonation
Users, groups, service accounts with role bindings. One-click impersonation — all API requests include `Impersonate-User` headers. Amber banner shows active impersonation across all pages.

### Auto-Generated Resource Tables
Every resource type gets sortable columns, search, per-column filters, bulk delete, keyboard navigation (j/k), CSV/JSON export, Edit YAML + Delete on every row, and inline scale controls for deployments.

### Smart Diagnosis with Log Analysis
10 error patterns detected from pod logs: Permission denied, Connection refused, OOM, DNS failure, read-only filesystem, wrong architecture — each with specific fix suggestions.

### YAML Editor
CodeMirror with K8s autocomplete, YAML linting, Schema panel (from CRD OpenAPI), 71 context-aware sub-snippets (insert at cursor), 30 full resource templates, inline diff view, keyboard shortcuts help.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Log in to your cluster
oc login --server=https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443

# Start the API proxy
oc proxy --port=8001 &

# Start the dev server (port 9000)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:9000. Clear `shiftops-ui-storage` from localStorage on first run to get default pinned tabs.

## Deploy to OpenShift

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Apply deployment manifests (Namespace, OAuthClient, Deployment, Service, Route)
oc apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml

# Build and push image
oc start-build shiftops --from-dir=. --follow -n shiftops

# Restart pods
oc rollout restart deployment/shiftops -n shiftops
```

The deployment includes:
- **OAuth proxy** sidecar with `user:full` scope for per-user authentication
- **nginx** reverse proxy forwarding user tokens to K8s API, Prometheus, Alertmanager
- **2 replicas** with PDB, topology spread, zero-downtime rolling updates
- **Security hardened**: runAsNonRoot, drop ALL capabilities, seccomp RuntimeDefault

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run 1103 tests
npm run type-check    # TypeScript checking
```
